# 🧠 People Detection with Heatmap Overlay

This project uses **YOLOv5** and **OpenCV** (with optional **Streamlit**) to perform **real-time people detection** in videos and generate a dynamic **heatmap** showing frequently occupied areas.

- 🎥 Upload or stream video for analysis
- 🧍 Detect people using YOLOv5 (`ultralytics` version)
- 🔥 Build a dynamic heatmap overlay showing crowd density
- 🖼️ Visualize results with bounding boxes and JET-colored heatmap
- 🧪 Web-based UI (Streamlit) or desktop viewer (OpenCV)
